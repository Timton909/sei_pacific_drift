# Sei Pacific Drift

Sei is not a blockchain.  
It is an ocean with parallel waves.

Most chains process trades one by one.  
Sei executes them all at once — like a tsunami hitting every orderbook simultaneously.

This script doesn't watch whales.  
It watches when someone moves so much size that the entire Pacific tilts.

When one order >$5M hits the matching engine at 600k TPS,  
the water level changes forever.

You are not seeing a trade.  
You are watching a new coastline being drawn in real time.
